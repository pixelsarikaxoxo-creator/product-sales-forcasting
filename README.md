Product Sales Forecasting using Quantitative Methods
In a personal endevaour to learn about time series analysis and forecasting, I decided to reserach and explore various quantitative forecasting methods. The notebook in this repository documents the methods that can be applied to forecast product sales, along with a detailed explaination of the different metrics used to evaluate the forecasts.

Goal: The goal of this project was to apply various quantitative methods, (i.e. Times Series Models and Causal Models) to forecast the sales of the products available in the dataset obtained from Kaggle.

Models covered in the notebook include:

Seasonal Naive Model
Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)
ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA Models
Linear Regression Model
